# A_MAZE_ING

This was submitted as a CSE 102 project made with [iGraphics](https://github.com/ImtiazKabir/iGraphics-boilerplate). So it is superbly rushed to the point where I don't want to maintain or improve it any further.

## Requirement
[Download MinGW](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sxl_Gz3xw7z5cyARiQ2cRu_vLVLno9aS/view?usp=sharing) and extract it in `C:\`. the binaries should stay in `C:\MinGW\MinGW\bin`

## Build and Run
### With CodeBlocks
Download this repository, and extract it if necessary. Then open the `template.cbp` with CodeBlocks. Then `Build and Run (F9)` to run.
### With Visual Studio Code
Download this repository, and extract it if necessary. Then open the folder with `VSCode`. Then Build with `Ctrl+Shift+F5` and run with `Ctrl+F5`
### From the terminal
Download this repository, and extract it if necessary. Then open a command prompt or powershell window in the folder. Build with `make` and run with `make run`

**Enjoy!**
